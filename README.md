# CIS1051Project
My CIS1051 project.  

# Subsection
My first project idea is creating a tic-tac-toe game. As a child I really liked playing tic tac toe and I feel that its a great way to showcase some of the things I learned in CIS1051.
## Subsubsection
I want to try to include open squares that you can click on.
I also want to try and implement a setting where you can play against on online opponent.
