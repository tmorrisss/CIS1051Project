# CIS1051Project
My CIS1051 project.  

# Subsection
My first project idea is creating a tic-tac-toe game. As a child I really liked playing tic tac toe and I feel that its a great way to showcase some of the things I learned in CIS1051.
## Subsubsection
I want to try to include open squares that you can click on.
I also want to try and implement a setting where you can play against on online opponent.

# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

I'm still in the works of a name, I'm trying to combine the game title Tic-Tac-Toe with the Anime theme I am aiming for.

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

An anime theme tic-tac-toe game. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My game will consist of a tic-tac-toe game created from python. It will be played on a regular tic-tac-toe board game with a few minor edits to the design of the board. It have a few anime names you can choose to play as and even customize your "X" and "O". 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I think a good outcome is completing the design of the game a the build in the anime feautures. And of course the game should run smoothly from start to finish. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I would like to incorporate different game designs based on the charater you choose to play as. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Including the previous outcome ideas I would like to incorporate a feature for you to play against an AI component. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

My next steps are to make sure the game runs smoothly first, I need to aquire the skills of building a game in python. After that I need to work on the customizations of the game.
