I created a tic-tac-toe game for my final project. I decided on this game because I used to love playing this game as a kid.
It would also be a fun way for me to learn PyGame.
Some of the diffculties I came across...
     Teaching myself PyGame was probably the most difficult part.
     Starting the game, I had to research a lot of different ways to start the game and the best way to build it how I want to.
     Adding a custom background was stressfully difficult, I was forced to use photoshop to ensure that the photo will fix in the game while also maintaining clarity.
     I had to learn different functions within pygame such as mixer:
        That wasn't very difficult, more fun if anything!
        Downloadign the song into PyGame was extremely frustrating
        I had to first turn it into a .mp3 to then a .ogg for it to work. It was a very long process. 
        But in the end, I was able to add the opening song to the first season on One Piece (brought back some great memories)
Some of the things I wanted to try but never got the chance to:
     I wanted to incorcopeate and AI component but I never got around to doing that 
     I wanted to make a scoreboard with the font feature in PyGame but as I kept trying I found it extremely difficult and I ran out of time.
     I wannted to customize the X's and O's with the faces of the anime character's in the anime but I never got around to doing that.
Those are some of the things I didn't get to do but I plan to still do in the future. 
This was such a fun project and as I did face some frustrations I learned to work through them and it definently made me a better programmer. 
I hope you enjoy the game as you play just as much as I enjoyed creating it!
